My own Game - FLAPPY BIRD!!

Hello,

In this game the PC(Playing Character) is the bird and the NPC(Non-Playing characters) are pipes.

Story : 

1 : There was a bird living in a zoo.

2 : It did not want live the rest of it's life in the cage. It wanted Freedom to live in the forest.

3 : Thus it finally decided to escape out of the zoo.

4 : Now it has somehow managed to come out of it's cage but the owner has fixed pipes so that no animals can escape out of the zoo.

5 : Now you will have to help the bird to escape out of the zoo by controlling the bird(see how to control the bird below).


Rules of the game : 


1 : There are 25 pipes which abstruct your path to win the game.
   Do NOT try to hit the pipes or else your bird will die!! because they are electrically charged.

2 :  For each pipe you save the bird from you will get 2 points.
     Thus, you will have to get 50 points! to win the game.


How to control the bird :
